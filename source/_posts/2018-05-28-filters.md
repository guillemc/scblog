We'll see the effect of different filter UGens using noise as a source.

#### White noise and Pink noise

`WhiteNoise` generates noise whose spectrum has equal power at all frequencies:

`PinkNoise` generates noise with equal power over the span of each octave.

We'll use white noise to see more clearly the effects of the filters.

------------------------------------

### `LPF`: Low pass filter

Takes as arguments an input signal and a cutoff frequency:

~~~
(
{
    var sig = WhiteNoise.ar(0.4);
    LPF.ar(sig, 600);
}.play
)
~~~

Replace `LPF` with `HPF` to obtain a high pass filter instead.


------------------------------------

### `BPF`: Band pass filter

Takes a signal, a center frequency and a *rq* (reciprocal of *Q*) vale.
*Q* is defined as centerFreq/bandwidth. Higher *Q* values mean narrower filters.

~~~
(
{
    var sig = WhiteNoise.ar(1);
    BPF.ar(sig, 600, 1/40);
}.play
)
~~~

Since a high *Q* filter results in quieter noise, we can compensate doing
something like:

~~~
(
{
	arg q = 40;
    var sig = WhiteNoise.ar();
    BPF.ar(sig, 600, q.reciprocal, q.sqrt);  // the mul value is adjusted with q
}.play
)
~~~

`BRF` (band reject filter) is the reciprocal of the `BPF`. Use low *Q*
values to obtain a wider rejection band.

------------------------------------

### `RLPF`: Resonant low pass filter

Same arguments as the `BPF`: signal, cutoff frequency and *rq*.

It is a low pass filter that emphasizes the cutoff frequency.

With low *Q* values it behaves just like a low pass filter.

Works great with `Saw` or other signals with lots of harmonics,
as it allows us to emphasize some of those harmonics:

~~~
(
{
    var sig = Saw.ar([60, 61], 0.3);
    RLPF.ar(sig, 600, 1/40);
}.play
)
~~~
