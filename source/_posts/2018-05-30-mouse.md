title: Using the mouse as a UGen
tags: [ugen, mouse, play]

`MouseX` and `MouseY` are mouse tracking UGens.

They work only at control rate (*kr*), and take 3 arguments:

- *minval*: value that will be output when the mouse is at the left/bottom edge of the screen.
- *maxval*: value that will be output when the mouse is at the right/top edge of the screen.
- *warp*: mapping curve (0 = linear, 1 = exponential)


In this example, mouse *y* controls the frquency of the saw wave,
while mouse *x* controls the filter's frequency cutoff:

~~~
(
x = {
	var freq, sig, cutoff;
    freq = MouseY.kr(30, 200, 1);
    freq.poll(5, 'Freq');              // poll the output 5 times/sec and post the result
	sig = Saw.ar([freq, freq*1.02], 0.3);
	cutoff = MouseX.kr(200, 3000, 1);
	RLPF.ar(sig, cutoff, 1/20) ! 2;
}.play
)
