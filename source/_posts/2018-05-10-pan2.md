`Pan2` takes an input signal and a position as arguments, and returns an array of two signals (left/right).

The position goes from -1 (left) to 1 (right), with 0 being the center.

~~~
(
{
    var sig, pos;
    sig = PinkNoise.ar(0.2);
    pos = SinOsc.kr(0.5);     // 2 seconds cycle
    Pan2.ar(sig, pos);
}.play;
)
~~~

Note that you can also use `!` (shortcut for the `dup` method) to perform simple multichannel expansion (note that the amplitudes add up in this case):

~~~
(
{
    var sig = PinkNoise.ar(0.2);
    sig!2;
}.play;
)
