This is a draft post. You will only see this if you are running the `dev`
environment (`dev` is the default).

All draft posts will automatically be tagged `draft` so they are easy to
find.

Sculpin has always been a big fan of [Markdown][1]. So this post was
written in Markdown. :)

[1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

Inline-style links allow linking some text to another web page. Surround the link with [brackets], followed by the URL inside parenthesis, like [this](https://michelf.ca/).

This is some text *emphased* with asterisks.

This is some __strong emphasis with underscores__.


To create an unordered list, use *, +, or - as item marker:

-   Sun
-   Moon
-   Earth


If you simply want to be able to click at an URL inserted in your text, put the URL between angle brackets and Markdown will make a clickable link with it:

<https://michelf.ca/>
